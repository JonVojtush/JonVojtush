## Bio

When I'm not developing ETL software for my current employer in healthcare, my wife, 2 sons & I are out finding some activity in whatever new city we are living in that week. Typically we find kid activities like playgrounds and fairs as well as hiking and many more outdoor activities. When I feel like gaming on my laptop I play Tribes 2, Tribes Rivals, Guild Wars 2 or Runescape. I used to work as a mechanic and love anything automotive; hydrogen-on-demand is underrated.
